1. The interface spring is defined by single stiffness parameter.
2. The bond breaks the axial (elongation) force in the interface spring reaches threshold value.
3. The bond between two nearest nodes in the upper and lower lattice, respectively, reforms:
	- the bond length is plus-minus 1% of critcal adhesion distance.
4. Adding hertzian contact
